The article, "[Will Programmers Become Obsolete Because of AI](https://www.techslang.com/will-programmers-become-obsolete-because-of-ai/)" in TECHSLANG discusses the future of software development and whether AI will eventually eliminate the need for software engineers. The article cites current progress, such as GPT-3, which can program webpages using JSX, CSS, and Python. However, GPT-3 commits errors which can be difficult for humans to correct. This suggests that in the present day, AI technology is not advanced enough to surpass the ability of humans.

Currently, AI can do many of the mundate tasks of software development, such as creating simple programs or autocompleting lines of code. However it has difficulty completing more complex tasks, even those that humans would find trivial. Eventually, however, it is a very real possibility that AI will be able to take over many human resonsibilities, a possibility that I found very interesting and disturbing. Are we essentially programming away the need for our own jobs as software engineers?!

Interesting article. Thanks for sharing! PS: you misspelled `eventually` as `evenutally` and `technology` as `techonology`. I have fixed that here and changed the style of your writing to be less informal. That wasn't a requirement of the assignment, but I couldn't help it. I hope you don't mind.
