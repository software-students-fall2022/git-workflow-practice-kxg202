# Git Practice

I found [this article](https://www.techslang.com/will-programmers-become-obsolete-because-of-ai/) to be very interesting, it talks about the future of software development and whether AI will eventually eliminate the need for software engineers. The article cites current progress, such as GPT-3 which can code up webpages using JSX, CSS, and Python. However, that program still commits errors which can be hard for humans to correct, meaning that in the present day, AI techonology is not advanced enough to surpass the ability of humans. Currently, AI can do the dirty work such as coding up simple programs or autocompleting lines of code, however it can't complete harder tasks. Evenutally however, it is a very real possibility that AI can take over humans, which I found very interesting and disturbing, as we are essentially programming away the need for our own jobs of being an SWE.
